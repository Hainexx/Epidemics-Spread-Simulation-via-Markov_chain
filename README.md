# Markov Chain Assignement Report

Consider the stochastic process of spread of an epidemics (of COVID-19, influenza, or other similar viruses) in a population composed by N individ- uals.
Assume that each individual at each time step can be in one of the fol- lowing 3 states:
• S = susceptible = not infected and not immune (then s/he can be infected)
• I = infected
• R = removed = recovered and immune, or dead
Assume also that at each time step each susceptible individual becomes in- fected with probability 0.09, each infected individual is removed with prob- ability 0.27 and each removed individual returns back to be susceptible with probability 0.09.
Represent the evolution of the epidemics as a Markov chain and write the transition matrix.
Imagine now that the number N of individuals in the population is N = 10000.
If is it possible, find what will be the number of individuals in the three states S,I,R in the long run, after many time steps.
